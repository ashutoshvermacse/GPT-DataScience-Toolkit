This project demonstrates the different ways in which the OpenAI API Python library can be utilised to handle data science problems.
OpenAI has several capabilities, including: 

--> Generate an SQL query from a screenshot of tables.

--> Design databases or write code using voice instructions.

--> Generate extensive reports from figures or diagrams

--> Create test routines.

--> Enhancing Code Readability 

--> Learning New Technical Concepts
