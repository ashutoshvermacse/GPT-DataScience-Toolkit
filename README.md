This project demonstrates the different ways in which GPT can be utilised to handle data science problems.  
GPT has several capabilities, including: 

--> Generating an SQL query from a screenshot of tables

--> Designing databases or writing code using voice instructions

--> Generating extensive reports from figures or diagrams

--> Creating test routines.

--> Enhancing code readability 

--> Explaining new technical concepts
