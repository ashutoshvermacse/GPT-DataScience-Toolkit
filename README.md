This project explores various applications of GPT for addressing data science challenges. GPT offers several functionalities that can be particularly useful in this context:

1. **Generating SQL Queries**: Convert screenshots of tables into SQL queries.
2. **Database Design and Coding**: Create databases or write code based on voice instructions.
3. **Report Generation**: Produce detailed reports from figures or diagrams.
4. **Test Routine Creation**: Develop test routines for evaluating code or algorithms.
5. **Code Enhancement**: Improve code readability and organization.
6. **Technical Explanation**: Clarify and explain new technical concepts.

Each of these capabilities demonstrates how GPT can streamline and enhance various aspects of working with data and programming.
