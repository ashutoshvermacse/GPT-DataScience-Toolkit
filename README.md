# GPT Data Science Toolkit

This project explores various applications of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to address data science challenges, leveraging the OpenAI API for enhanced functionality. The toolkit demonstrates how GPT can streamline and enhance multiple aspects of data science and programming:

-**'Generating SQL Queries:'** Converts screenshots of tables into SQL queries.
-**'Database Design and Coding:'** Creates databases or writes code based on voice instructions.
-**'Report Generation:'** Produces detailed reports from figures or diagrams.
-**'Test Routine Creation:'** Develops test routines for evaluating code or algorithms.
-**'Code Enhancement:'** Improves code readability and organization.
-**'Technical Explanation:'** Clarifies and explains new technical concepts.
Each capability showcases how GPT can be effectively utilized to simplify and improve tasks in data science and programming.
